The idyllic rural setting and unparalleled beauty of the surroundings provide an exceptional sense of escapism from the outside world. All bookings at Eastwood are for exclusive use, meaning that groups are free to use the space as suits them best at times that work best for them.",
          "Whilst there is no doubt that Eastwood provides a sense of grand informality, there is a dedicated team on hand to help make sure guests are incredibly well cared for – in much the same way as you’d expect from a very attentive boutique hotel. There is an option of a full housekeeping service including breakfast and coffee whenever required, not to mention a personal chef who can create delicious three course dinners to the clients’ specific requirements. And there are a range of options for meeting rooms and presentation facilities, that work for small groups on a corporate retreat or larger groups on company away days.",
          "Once the work is done for the day, Eastwood is brilliantly set up for corporate team building. There are a multitude of activities available – all of which are available within the grounds of the 32 acre estate. Clay pigeon shooting takes place in the rolling pastures to the east of the main house, with friendly and experienced instructors able to set up a series of stations to suit any experience level. Equally, the in-house chef, can run fully immersive cooking courses culminating in fabulous dinner served to the group, which is wonderful way of informal team building. Another activity that is really popular with corporate groups is a full height mobile climbing wall that brings you face to face with Eastwood’s famous lion on the top floor of the building!",
