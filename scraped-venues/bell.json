          "We look after everything from simple morning sessions to launch events and hands-on creative workshops. We work with a carefully chosen group of partners who help us deliver sessions that open ideas and encourage fresh conversation. If you prefer something more laid back, we can arrange wine, gin or cocktail masterclasses as part of your day.",

          "From relaxed, personal dinners to grand occasions with music, drinks, and dancing, our spaces create memorable experiences in a warm and welcoming setting. Whatever the occasion, we make it feel completely your own",
          "The Bell is proud to be a 5* inn with two AA Rosettes, and the winner of Community Spaces at The Pineapples. Recognition that reflects not just the food, service and rooms, but the role The Bell plays as a creative, welcoming space at the heart of its community.",
          "Whatever it is you are planning, our team’s in-depth knowledge of our spaces makes them the ideal experts to help you create an occasion that feels effortless, enjoyable and unmistakably Bell."
